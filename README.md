# AMLA_Teacher
A small Wesnoth modification that adds a "Teacher" advancement option for units that reached AMLA.
The Teacher redistributes it's own XP to units around it at every turn. This makes them gaining XP gain less wasteful, while still providing some interesting decistion in positioning units.

## Compatibility
Compatible with most campaigns and scenarios.
Might break campaigns, scenarios and other modifications that depend on AMLA. Depending on the implementation, simply not choosing "Teacher" as an advancement might solve the issue.

## Giants I'm standing on
Based heavily on Garak's ability in UtBS and the LotI custom advancements mod.
