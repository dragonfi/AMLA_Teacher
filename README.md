# AMLA_Teacher
A small Wesnoth modification that adds a "Teacher" advancement option for units that reached AMLA.
The Teacher redistributes it's own XP to units around it at every turn.
This makes using AMLA units less wasteful, while still providing some interesting decision in positioning units.

## Compatibility
Might break campaigns, scenarios and other modifications that depend on AMLA. Depending on the implementation, simply not choosing "Teacher" as an advancement might solve the issue.

## Giants I'm standing on
Based heavily on Garak's ability in UtBS and the LotI custom advancements mod.
